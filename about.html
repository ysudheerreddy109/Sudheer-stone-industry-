            Naming of Tandur stones:
        </h1>
        <p>
            As we have explained above a stone mountain is passing through various Towns and villages of Karnataka and Telangana states, the stones excavated Is also named according to the village or town name.

        <br>
            Tandur stone price is very low than marble and granite,tandur stones are named after the mandal of the same name, about 125 km from Hyderabad, in which they are quarried. Tandur blue and white limestone slabs are the preferred flooring material for the middle-class, which finds granite and marble expensive.tandur is the main producer and distributor of the blue limestone used for flooring and wall cladding and sometimes even for slabs.<br>We offer our range of Tandur Kota Stone, which are available in different specifications of sizes and shapes.
